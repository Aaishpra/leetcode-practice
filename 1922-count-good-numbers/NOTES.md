total numbers = n
odd numbers #o = n/2
even numbers #e = n/2 +n%2
​
0-9
even numbers = 0 2 4 6 8  = 5 = 9/2+9%2
prime numbers = 1 3 5 7 = 4
​
for n=4
e p e p e
5 4 5 4 5
ie= pow(5,#e)*pow(4,#o)
now since the complexity is 10^15 cant use tarversing
and normal power function hence we should use better power function along with mod since answer is large
